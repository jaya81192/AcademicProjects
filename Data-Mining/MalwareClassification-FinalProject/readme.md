Below is a brief description of each java file

###<b>GenerateFrequency.java</b>
Reads the folder containing all the asm files, parses the content line by line and generates the opcode frequency for the file. HashMap is used to maintain the opcode frequency for each file and HashSet containing the global list of opcodes is used for matching each word to extract the opcode. Several optimizations are done in the parsing process like reading only the lines containing opcode information and using constant time retrieval data structures.

###<b>Computefeaturelist.java</b>
From the opcodebigram frequency that has been generated for each file, this code computes the list of total features using a HshSet. This list will then be used to create the input file for the classifier.

###<b>Filterfeature.java</b>
From the generated input file(bigram) for classifier, filtered feature list is obtained. Filteration is done by searching the number of files containing non-zero values for each feature. The features exceeding a set frequency threshold value are generated. HashSet, HashMap and ArrayList datastructures are used.

###<b>ComputeFeature.java</b>
From the opcodebigram frequency and final bigram feature list, the input file for classifier with all the bigram features 
along with its frequencies for each file is generated in this code. HashSet and HashMap datastructures are used.

###<b>computetrigramfeatures.java</b>
From the opcode trigram frequency that has been generated for each file, this code computes the list of total features using a HshSet. This list will then be used to create the input file for the classifier.

###<b>ComputeTrigramfeature.java</b>
From the opcode Trigram frequency and final Trigram feature list, the input file for classifier with all the Trigram features along with its frequencies for each file is generated in this code. HashSet and HashMap datastructures are used.

###<b>filtertrigramfeature.java</b>
From the generated input file(trigram) for classifier, filtered feature list is obtained. Filteration is done by searching the number of files containing non-zero values for each feature. The features exceeding a set frequency threshold value are generated. HashSet, HashMap and ArrayList datastructures are used.

###<b>computeunigramfeatureset.java</b>
From the opcode unigram frequency that has been generated for each file, this code computes the list of total features using a HshSet. This list will then be used to create the input file for the classifier.

###<b>computeunigramsfeatures.java</b>
From the opcode unigram frequency and final unigram feature list, the input file for classifier with all the unigram features along with its frequencies for each file is generated in this code. HashSet and HashMap datastructures are used.
